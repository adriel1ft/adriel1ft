### Hi there 👋

I’m a data enthusiast and tech student with hands-on experience in data analysis, data engineering, and machine learning models. I'm also passionate about building chatbots using Large Language Models (LLMs) to create intelligent, interactive experiences.

- 📊 Experienced in data analysis and pipeline creation for insights and process automation
- 🧑‍💻 Skilled in designing machine learning models for predictive analytics
- 🤖 Focused on developing chatbots and conversational AI with LLMs
- 🚀 Currently learning about Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to enhance AI responses with relevant data retrieval

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new tech tools, staying updated with AI trends, and working on side projects.

Feel free to connect or reach out!
